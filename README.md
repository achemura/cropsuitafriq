R codes used for crating crop suitability maps for 23 crops in Africa under climate change. 

The code produces 2 datasets (i) crop specific suitability between 0 and 1 and (ii) binary suitability for suitable and unsuitable by converting the suitability index according to a threshold from the calibration [0,1]. These are for current/baseline climatic conditions (Fig. 4).  For future projections we provide the mean and median of the 10 GCMs for cereals (Fig. 5), legumes and pulses, root and tuber crops  and banana family  by 2050. Crop suitability data provide a narrative of when, where, and what type of crop can potentially grow under different GHG emissions and climate scenarios.
